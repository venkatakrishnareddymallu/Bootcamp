# Formhandler editing

- [x] Clear documentation
  - [ ] Add row needs documentation
  - [ ] Actions are poorly explained
- [ ] Usable
  - [ ] If the server responds with a Bad Request, show the actual error message
  - [ ] When using keyboard navigation, changed inputs are not detected as dirty
  - [ ] Loading indicator is not visible
  - [ ] Simulate server / network failure and test. If data is lost, user should be aware
  - [ ] How to edit primary keys
  - [ ] Icon URLs are static. They must be based on the row data -- either as a string template or function
- [ ] Code size is compact and corrrect
  - [ ] Do not use encodeURIComponent to escape selectors. Use quotes instead. Remove quotes if they exist in the name
  - [ ] Do we need to check for `if (dirty_td.length > 0) {`
  - [ ] `options.edit.editFunction()` should probably be `options.edit.editFunction` -- and should probably be `edit.function`. Also call editFunction on `.done()` if it is defined. Not via `complete:`. Always use promises
  - [ ] `if (options[name] == 'grid') name = 'table_grid'` is duplicated
- [ ] Code is readable
  - [ ] Rename `compile_template()` to `render_template()` and document it



- [ ] Tests cover all API specs
